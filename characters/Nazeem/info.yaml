name: Nazeem
bio: >
  Nazeem is a Redguard citizen in Skyrim who resides in the upstairs room of The Drunken Huntsman. He, along with his wife Ahlam, owns Chillfurrow Farm, which is located south of Whiterun. During waking hours, he visits the marketplace and inspects the wares on display, while conversing with, and insulting, various merchants. In the afternoon, he wanders around town, and then finishes his day by sitting in The Drunken Huntsman. He also goes to bed there instead of Chillfurrow Farm.He looks down on (and speaks condescendingly to) anyone who isn't a noble, and claims to advise Balgruuf the Greater on political matters.

    Oh, it took years, but I earned my way to the top. I own Chillfurrow Farm, you see. Very successful business. Obviously.

    I actually advise the Jarl on political matters. My input is invaluable, of course. But this is all probably a bit over your head.
