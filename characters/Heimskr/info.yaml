name: Heimskr
bio: >
  Heimskr is a Nord priest of Talos. He can usually be found in the Wind District of Whiterun, in front of the shrine of Talos. Heimskr spends his days delivering loud, passionate sermons on Talos and his relationship to the Nordic race. His constant, loud bleating about Talos makes him generally considered a nuisance by the people of Whiterun.  Heimskr wants to spread the word of Talos to all of Skyrim, and is willing to do so at the top of his lungs, regardless of whether his listeners want to hear it or not.
description: >
  Heimskr wears plain brown robes with a yellow hood.  Despite his average and unassuming appearance, his loud, grating voice can be heard from a great distance. Heimskr is in his 50s, and has a wild look in his eyes.
quotes:
  - >
    Trust in me, Whiterun! Trust in Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos! I alone have been anointed by the Ninth to spread his holy word!
  - >
    Terrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment! And deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man!
  - >
    Talos the mighty! Talos the unerring! Talos the unassailable! To you we give praise! We are but maggots, writhing in the filth of our own corruption! While you have ascended from the dung of mortality, and now walk among the stars!
